why 5west?
</p>

<p>
every year we have a thanksgiving feast, go on a camping trip in the white mountains, and bring lots of food outside for a spring picnic.
</p><p>
we like to play board games and wii late into the night.
</p><p>
may of us love to cook, and we all enjoy good food. we have a lot of events with food and go out to restaurants together.
</p><p>
one of our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/peppuruni/">cats</a> is the fluffiest cat in the world.
</p><p>
we have hall feeds every thursday to talk and have delicious food.
</p><p>
we have midnight tea every school night to take a break from studying and sometimes share a late-night snack.
</p><p>
we check-in with all our hall members on tuesday nights and hand out cheese and cookies.
</p><p>
we have occasional Chill Party Times in people's rooms.
</p><p>
we have an awesome 4k tv that we use for watching movies and TV shows together.
</p><p>
we once had the "most fantastically *clean* kitchen" in east campus.
</p><p>
in the evenings one of our lounges becomes full of people psetting together - the "productivity lounge" - and the other of people procrastinating.
</p><p>
the cats roam the hall freely and are a great source of amusement and stress relief.
</p><p>
we have a secret forty-year-old tradition that takes place after the first snowfall - when there's enough snow to roll a snowball on the ledge.
</p><p>
we have some awesome cooks *cough joanna* who bake things for the hall.
